---

## Data Processing Algorithms

### 1. ID Filtering & Dataset Preparation (`ids.py`)
**Purpose**: Filter IMDb dataset to prevent derivation of copyrighted content while maintaining quality.

**Algorithm**:
```python
# Quality-based filtering with temporal constraints
filtered_movies = movies.filter([
    title_type ∈ {"movie", "tvMovie"},
    start_year ≥ 1970,
    num_votes ≥ 2500,
    average_rating ≥ 1.0
]).transform(
    tconst → tid  # Remove 'tt' prefix, cast to UInt32
)
```

**Key Features**:
- **Temporal filtering**: Movies from 1970+ for cultural relevance
- **Popularity threshold**: 2500+ votes ensures cultural significance
- **ID transformation**: Converts IMDb tconst to compact integer representation

### 2. Ratings Fusion Algorithm (`ratings.py`)
**Purpose**: Combine user ratings and critic scores using Bayesian adjustment with intelligent fallbacks.

**Core Algorithm - Bayesian Rating Adjustment**:
```python
bayesian_rating = (votes/(votes + mean_votes)) * user_rating + 
                  (mean_votes/(votes + mean_votes)) * global_mean_rating
```

**Advanced Features**:
- **Multi-source fusion**: Combines IMDb user ratings with Metacritic scores
- **Fallback hierarchy**: User ratings → Metascore → Drop if neither available
- **Controversy detection**: Measures user-critic disagreement weighted by vote count
- **Normalization**: All ratings scaled to [0,1] for consistency

**Statistical Robustness**:
- Addresses sample size bias through Bayesian priors
- Handles missing data gracefully with statistical fallbacks
- Controversy score: `|user_rating - critic_score| × min(votes, mean_votes)/mean_votes`

### 3. Scalar Normalization (`scalar_norm.py`)
**Purpose**: Min-max normalization for numerical features to enable effective embedding combination.

**Algorithm**: 
```python
normalized_value = (value - min_value) / (max_value - min_value)
```

**Features**:
- **Multi-column normalization**: year, runtime, votes, ratings, metascores
- **Edge case handling**: When max = min, defaults to 0.5
- **Prefix convention**: Normalized columns prefixed with `sn_` (e.g., `sn_year`)

## Machine Learning Embedding Techniques

### 1. Plot Embeddings (`embedding.py`)
**Model**: `intfloat/multilingual-e5-large` (1024-dimensional)

**Key Features**:
- **Multilingual support**: Handles international cinema
- **E5 optimization**: Uses "passage: " prefix for optimal semantic encoding
- **Batch processing**: Efficient GPU/CPU utilization with configurable batch sizes
- **Checkpoint system**: Resumable processing for large datasets

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
plot_embeddings = sentence_transformer.encode([
    f"passage: {plot_text}" for plot_text in movie_plots
], convert_to_numpy=True)
```

### 2. Enriched Genre Embeddings
**Innovation**: Combines categorical genre data with plot-based clustering for thematic understanding.

**Algorithm**:
1. **Genre Grouping**: Group movies by genre combinations
2. **Plot-based Sub-clustering**: Within each genre group, cluster by plot similarity using KMeans
3. **Vector Enrichment**: Create high-dimensional representations incorporating both genre and plot patterns

**Key Benefits**:
- **Semantic understanding**: Distinguishes "sci-fi comedy" from "sci-fi thriller"
- **Reduced sparsity**: Plot clustering handles genre combinations not seen in training
- **Adaptive clustering**: Number of sub-clusters scales with group size

### 3. Culturally-Aware Localization Embeddings (`culturally_aware_embedding.py`)
**Major Innovation**: 128-dimensional localization vectors for effective cultural filtering without semantic loss.

#### Core Algorithm - Cultural Feature Mapping
```python
# Multi-level feature mapping for cultural signals
primary_signal = hash(country + language) % target_dim * 0.8
secondary_signal = hash(country + offset) % target_dim * 0.6  
tertiary_signal = hash(language + offset) % target_dim * 0.3

# Combine signals with collision avoidance
localization_vector[primary_index] += primary_signal
localization_vector[secondary_index] += secondary_signal
# ... tertiary mapping for robustness
```

#### Advanced Features
- **Plot-enriched clustering**: Similar to genre embeddings, groups by cultural features then sub-clusters by plot
- **Signal strength hierarchy**: Primary (0.8) → Secondary (0.6) → Tertiary (0.3) for robust representation
- **Hash-based mapping**: Deterministic feature placement with collision mitigation
- **Cultural vocabulary**: 403 unique country/language combinations

### 4. Popularity Boost Algorithm
**Purpose**: Promote culturally iconic films without distorting semantic space.

**Formula**:
```python
# Logarithmic scaling with exponential boost for high popularity
log_boost = log(votes / 1000 + 1)
exponential_boost = (normalized_rating ** 1.5) if rating > 0.1 else 0.01
popularity_score = clamp(log_boost * exponential_boost, 0.01, 2.0)
```

**Features**:
- **Non-linear scaling**: Logarithmic vote scaling prevents outlier dominance
- **Quality gating**: Exponential boost only for well-rated films
- **Bounded range**: [0.01, 2.0] prevents extreme distortion

## Runtime-Weighted Search Engine (`runtime_weighted_search.py`)

### Core Innovation: Dynamic Component Combination
**Problem Solved**: Traditional systems require index rebuilding for different cultural preferences.

**Solution**: Store embedding components separately and combine at query time.

### Algorithm
1. **Component Storage**: 
   ```python
   components = {
       'plot_embeddings': (N, 1024),      # Semantic content
       'genre_embeddings': (N, 64),       # Thematic categories  
       'localization_embeddings': (N, 128), # Cultural relevance
       'popularity_vectors': (N, 1)        # Iconicity boost
   }
   ```

2. **Runtime Combination**:
   ```python
   combined_embedding = concat([
       plot_embeddings * plot_weight,
       genre_embeddings * genre_weight,
       localization_embeddings * localization_weight,
       popularity_vectors * popularity_weight
   ])
   ```

3. **Query Processing**: Create query embeddings with identical weights and search using FAISS cosine similarity.

### Preset Configurations
- **Balanced** (0.5, 0.25, 0.1, 0.15): General purpose
- **Popular** (0.4, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2): Mainstream focus
- **Cultural** (0.44, 0.13, 0.1, 0.33): Regional cinema emphasis
- **Niche** (0.6, 0.3, 0.05, 0.05): Art house/independent films

## Moral and Ethical Considerations

### Overview
ReelRaider's development prioritizes ethical AI practices, cultural sensitivity, and responsible data usage. The system addresses several critical ethical considerations inherent in culturally-aware recommendation systems while maintaining transparency and user agency.

### 1. Cultural Representation and Bias

#### **Avoiding Cultural Stereotyping**
**Challenge**: AI systems risk reinforcing cultural stereotypes or oversimplifying complex cultural identities.

**Our Approach**:
- **Multi-dimensional representation**: 128-dimensional localization vectors capture cultural nuance beyond simple country/language labels
- **Plot-cultural integration**: Movies are sub-clustered by actual thematic content, not just cultural tags
- **Semantic balance**: Cultural weights are balanced with semantic similarity to prevent pure stereotyping

**Example**: The system doesn't assume all Japanese films are samurai movies - it clusters "Japanese horror" separately from "Japanese romance" based on actual plot content.

#### **Cultural Sensitivity in Recommendations**
**Principle**: Respect cultural context without imposing external judgments about cultural "value."

**Implementation**:
- **User agency**: Cultural preferences are user-controlled, not system-imposed
- **Balanced presets**: Multiple recommendation modes (balanced, popular, cultural, niche) give users choice
- **Transparent weighting**: Users can see and adjust cultural vs. semantic weights

### 2. Data Ethics and Privacy

#### **Responsible Data Usage**
**IMDb Data Handling**:
- **ID-only processing**: System extracts only movie IDs from IMDb data to prevent copyright derivation
- **Quality filtering**: Focuses on culturally significant films (2500+ votes) rather than comprehensive cataloging
- **Temporal boundaries**: 1970+ filter ensures contemporary cultural relevance

**OMDb Integration**:
- **Legitimate API usage**: All movie metadata sourced through official OMDb API
- **Rate limiting**: Respects API terms and usage limits
- **Attribution**: Proper crediting of data sources

#### **User Privacy**
**Search Privacy**:
- **No user tracking**: System doesn't store user search history or preferences
- **Query anonymization**: Individual searches are not linked to user identities
- **Cultural preference handling**: User's cultural settings are session-based, not profiled

### 3. Algorithmic Fairness and Representation

#### **Addressing Popularity Bias**
**Problem**: Traditional recommendation systems favor mainstream/popular content, marginalizing diverse voices.

**Our Solution**:
- **Configurable popularity weighting**: Users can adjust or disable popularity boost
- **Niche preset**: Dedicated mode (0.6 plot, 0.3 genre, 0.05 cultural, 0.05 popularity) for discovering underrepresented films
- **Balanced defaults**: Default weights prevent extreme popularity bias

#### **Cultural Equity**
**Principle**: Ensure representation across different film industries and cultural contexts.

**Metrics**:
- **403 unique country/language combinations** in cultural vocabulary
- **Multilingual support**: E5-large model handles international film descriptions
- **Regional cinema emphasis**: Cultural preset specifically designed for non-Hollywood films

### 4. Transparency and Explainability
